After nearly six years, I left [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com) last month. When I joined, I had no idea how defining this experience would be or that we'd grow to almost four hundred employees. As I embark on a new journey, I'm thankful for all the friendships and challenges I learned from, spanning from product, engineering, and analytics to the intangible aspects of building an organization ground up.

The past several weeks, I got to travel and work on an early-stage project for [Benchmark](http://www.benchmark.com). Now, I'm excited to join [Costanoa Ventures](https://www.costanoavc.com) in the San Francisco Bay Area for an internship before starting the next chapter of my life as an MS/MBA candidate at the [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu) and the [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu).
