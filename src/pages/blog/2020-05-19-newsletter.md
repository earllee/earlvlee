*I'm considering starting a newsletter so have been jotting down thoughts from content I'm consuming. This is a working draft of the first newsletter, so a lot of these points are half-baked.*

- 🧠 **Musing: Lyft-Doordash Merger**
    - They're both partnered with Chase Sapphire to reward its Reserve card members.
    - They both battle the Uber-Uber Eats-GrubHub (last one tentative).
    - Can increase leverage over driver supply as combined company.
- 🗞️ [**Scale & loyalty more important online than offline, CAC is new rent - Gavin Baker**](https://medium.com/@gavin_baker/scale-and-loyalty-are-more-important-online-than-offline-which-drives-much-of-the-winner-take-992345be93a9)
    - CAC is the new rent
- 💰 **Spotify a good buy?**
    - 
- 📫 **Substack Adoption**
    - Interesting to see acceleration in Substack adoption. Many friends starting their own newsletter. Lower barrier to entry than podcasts—you don't need to know how to speak well or have high quality microphones. Just write. Editing is easier too.
    - Feels like newsletters are the new old-school blogs, easier to create than podcasts and more thoughtful than tweets. Last generation of newsletters were collection of links. Now, the best newsletters are collection of analysis on news. Lets readers peer into the thought process.
- 💻 **Remote work**
    - With more companies announcing plans to make remote work a permanent fixture—in part or whole—even post-COVID-19 there will be second-order effects for how office workers get social interaction. I hypothesize the growth of local communities oriented around interest such as sports, entertainment, and hobbies.
- 🎙 **Did I get podcasting wrong?**
    - Assessed the space last summer and thought it was not an investible space. Lot's of companies popping up. Lot's of big players moving in. Lot's of acquisitions.
    - Passive media
    - Rise of authentic thoughts and communication because Internet and media is now too curated
- 💼 **Seeing both tech culture and business school/finance culture**
    - Design is underrated, noted by the absence of what people talk about it conversation. No on talks about design or products. Always business plans. Rollups. etc.
