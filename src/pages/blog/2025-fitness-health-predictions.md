It’s been a while since I’ve posted here, but one of my 2025 goals is to more consistently create content about things I'm passionate about. Fitness is definitely one of them if not the most prominent one. To kick things of, I wanted to share a few trends I think have been shaping up over the past year and will likely continue to grow or break out in 2025.

### 2024 Recap

But first, let's take a look back at 2024. We saw the rise of run clubs, luxury fitness clubs, strength training, longevity, GLP-1s, and Oura/WHOOP duopoly.

- **Run Clubs**: Really broke out in 2024 primarily due to the social aspect of running with a group.
- **Luxury Fitness Clubs**: With a growing awareness around holistic health and recovery, which have grown thanks to WHOOP and Oura popularizing recovery and consumer products like Theraguns, NormaTec compression boots, and cold plunges providing tools to improve recovery, we're now seeing that manifest in fitness clubs like Live Love Life and Continuum. I think this trend will continue to grow in 2025, but I'm skeptical consumer willingness to pay $300+ a month for a membership will reach broad enough adoption to make it a mainstream trend.
- **Longevity**: This one still feels like a bit of a sleeper, but thanks to Bryan Johnson's Blueprint brand and Peter Attia's Outlive book, we're seeing growing awareness around longevity.
- **GLP-1s**: This ones pretty obvious, but weight loss drugs really broke out last year. The biggest winners outside of Lilly and Novo Nordisk were startups like Hims and Fella which provide a telehealth model for getting easy access to these drugs.
- **Oura**: I initially wrote this as the "WHOOP/Oura Duopoly", but after looking up some stats, it really seems like 2024 was Oura's year, and it's starting to compound its user base much more quickly than WHOOP. Oura's slight reframe towards general wellness and doubling down on its unique fashion and women-centric benefits have started to pay off.

I think all of these trends will continue to grow in 2025, but I see run clubs, GLP-1s, and Oura to be the compounders. Luxury fitness clubs and longevity I think are more likely to be a few years out from becoming mainstream.


### 2025 Predictions

- **Microplastics Aversion**: I think microplastics are poised to become the next big personal health concern as public awareness is growing fast, spurred by recent investigations like [PlasticList.org](https://plasticlist.org/), [ProPublica’s deep dive into 3M's cover-up](https://www.propublica.org/article/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-inside-story) and [Andrew Huberman’s podcasts on the health risks of plastics](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-microplastics-on-your-health-how-to-reduce-them). We might start to see more brands tout low leakage of microplastics in their packaging and products (think Owala and Stanley stainless steel water bottles)as well as new product categories emerge or take off around microplastic reduction (think specialized water filters for skincare routines or single-use cotton face towels). Personally, I've started to avoid mixing hot water and plastic bags or containers including plastic tea steepers (apparently, the traditional tea bag leaks a ton of microplastics). This is unfortunately bearish news for sous-vide, which involves cooking meats in plastic bags simmering in hot water.
- **HYROX and Hybrid Fitness**: As someone who has focused exclusively on endurance and strength sports during different periods of my life, this one's a really exciting trend to watch. HYROX, a fitness race that started in Hamburg back in 2017 is now over [600,000 racers](https://athletechnews.com/hyrox-notches-5000-training-clubs-adds-performance-centers-athletech/) strong and more than doubling year over year. Cardio oriented workouts have always been popular, but HYROX is a great example of how the average consumer is increasingly gravitating towards multiple modalities of fitness and strength training becoming more popular for overall wellness. The format is accessible and easy to understand because it's  eight 1 km runs with an exercise in between each like 100 wall balls or 200m farmer's carry. On the business side, it's very scalable. Unlike Tough Mudder or CrossFit, HYROX requires a consistent set of simple equipment and a convention center sized space, making it highly replicable across cities. The race also closely mirrors what popular boutique fitness gyms like an F45 have its members do, so is better aligned with the majority of folks who frequent workout classes. Races in most major cities completely sell out now, and they only recently made a concerted effort to grow in the U.S.
- **Precision Testing**: I've noticed an uptick in friends getting DEXA scans, VO2 max tests, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) assessments. I think we're still early on this one, but I gradually see these tests becoming more mainstream as the tooling gets cheaper and more compact, demand grows around complementary products and services around running and hybrid fitness, and the rise of luxury fitness clubs start to include these types of tests as a service.
